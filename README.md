PLEASE DON'T CANCEL RNA_CODON_TABLE.TXT it is necessary for the code to run (ex. prot)
hi, there are some results which are too big, so since there is the possibility on rosalind to submit it as a file in some of the codes you can find both print and the creation of a file.
i don't remember if their gonna get checked through rosalind directly, in that case i highly suggest to delete the txts (all the file enter as their default name, "rosalind_nameexercise"),
in that case please don't cancel the rna_codon_table.txt because it's really important
